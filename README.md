This piece of art has been coded to work without you having to do anything and
will keep creating random patterns of colours by moving around by itself as well
as if you decide to refresh the page so all you have to do is watch and enjoy!

I originally had the idea of a moving train-like shape that would follow your
mouse cursor around however I decided this would be too hard for me to create
and understand so instead I created this randomised piece of art that uses
coloured lines.
